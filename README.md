# Door to Door web App

### Overview
The goal of the Passion Project module is to provide each student with an opportunity to individually explore and expand their abilities within a hands-on project-based setting.

The student will perform all roles including:

Product Owner
Product Designer/Planner
Project Manager
Designer
Dev Ops
Developer


Students are able to use the tech stack of their choice.

### Essential Features

#### Milestone 1
Conversation Tracking - Tracking the simple out come of a conversations using slips of paper cut from the attached form. Participants will log into the app and either open a profile or just enter their data with the tap of an icon.

#### Milestone 2
Testimony Tracking - Tied to the first one, but when participants witness someone that will like to share something during the door to door visits. The app could allow someone to submit images, videos, and text entries and share via WhatsApp.

#### Milestone 3
Resource folder - At times during conversation door to door, volunteers will pull out their phone and share textbook quotes. It would awesome to have an app that could provide content in a few different folders depending on the format of the file.

#### Milestone 4
Door to Door Tracking - This is probably the most complex.  A way to track door by door results of whether a conversation take place, how that conversation went, and what kind of follow up would be ideal. If possible have a map function where we could see how houses responded, or basically just an address based app that allows for the tracking of outcomes house by house.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
